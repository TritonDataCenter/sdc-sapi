# Development

To run a SAPI server locally:

    git clone git@git.joyent.com:sapi.git
    cd sapi
    git submodule update --init
    make all
    node server.js

Before commiting/pushing run `make prepush` and, if warranted, get a code
review.


# Testing

To test, SSH to your test machine and run:

    # sdc-login sapi
    # /opt/smartdc/sapi/tests/runtests

The full test suite takes approximately 8-10 minutes to run.  It also requires
that both the IMGAPI and SAPI zones have external NICs, to communicate with
updates.joyent.com.  Run this on the headnode for each that doesn't already
have an external nic:

    /usbkey/scripts/add_external_nic.sh $(vmadm lookup -1 alias=~sapi)
    /usbkey/scripts/add_external_nic.sh $(vmadm lookup -1 alias=~imgapi)

To run a single test (for example):

    TEST_SAPI_PROTO_MODE=false ./node_modules/.bin/nodeunit \
        ./test/mode.test.js -t 'upgrade to full mode'

When running tests, the SAPI SMF service will be disabled so the server logs
will be rewritten by nodeunit on a separate file located at:

    /opt/smartdc/sapi/test/tests.log
